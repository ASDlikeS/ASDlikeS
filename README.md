### Hi :skull:, I'm a Penetration Tester and Web Developer with a passion for security and coding. I specialize in identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and improving the security of web applications. As a web developer, I focus primarily on building web applications using **TypeScript**, **JS**, **REACT**, **ANGULAR**.

## Skills
- **Penetration Testing**: Conducting security assessments, discovering vulnerabilities, and creating exploits.
- **Web Development**: Building secure and efficient web applications, using technologies such as **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, and modern web frameworks.
- **Vulnerability Exploitation**: Creating exploits for common vulnerabilities and demonstrating their impact.
## Projects
I will be creating repositories for the public, where I will share various scripts and exploits for common vulnerabilities. These projects will help both security professionals and developers understand vulnerabilities and how to address them.
Stay tuned for updates as I share my work on:
- Exploits :gun:
- Security scripts :gun:
- Vulnerability research :gun:
Feel free to contribute, raise issues, or ask questions. Let's learn and grow together in the field of web security!
