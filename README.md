# :japanese_ogre: :skull: Hi, I'm ASD 
**Fullstack Developer & Pentester** who loves to break things to build them better.

### 💼 **About Me**  
I live in the intersection of **building robust systems** and **breaking them ethically**. When I'm not crafting smooth UIs with React or designing scalable backends with Django/Nest.js, I'm probably:  
- 🕵️♂️ Penetration testing web apps, APIs, and cloud infra (Docker/K8s/Ansible are my playgrounds).  
- 🧩 Writing Python/JS automation scripts to make hacking (and life) faster.  
- 🔄 Breaking CI/CD pipelines... then fixing them.  

My code is clean, my exploits are cleaner.
